# Enterprise Serverless Demo

## Getting Started

Download and install the necessary requirements, and then open the solution and run the project. The Azure Functions runtime will load up on your machine and is the same runtime that runs in Azure.

You will use Azure Storage Explorer to interact with your local Storage (blob and queues) along with a Cosmos DB emulator, so make sure you install those components.

### Requirements

You will need to have an active Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, [free accounts are available](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or use a sandbox from [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).
